### Changing the passphrase
While it is optional, it is recommended to change the passphrase when you first come into your position.  
The instructions can be found at [this link](https://help.passbolt.com/faq/security/change-passphrase)  
Please note that if you do so, you will need to share the new passphrase with the sys admin.
